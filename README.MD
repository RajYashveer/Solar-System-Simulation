# Simple Unity Solar System Simulation


Our project has the potential to include augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) visualization of the solar system. This feature would provide students with a unique and immersive learning experience, allowing them to explore and understand the relationships between the planets, stars, and other celestial objects in our solar system.


*Here's a gif of the simulation system:*
